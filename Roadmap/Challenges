Choose any one challenge from the three (3) options given below. You could choose to develop a browser-based web application or a native mobile application.
You are free to use any technology, framework, programming language(s), database(s), and cloud platform of your choice.

Face Recognition
  Develop a browser-based application or a native mobile application to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition technology.

  You could choose to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition in any area of application of your choice, for example:

  - Preventing crime 
  - Device security
  - Smarter advertising
  - Finding mission people or lost pets
  - Diagnose diseases
  - Tracking attendance
  - Facilitate secure transactions
  - You are free to choose any Face API you are comfortable with.
  
Data Analysis
  Develop an application to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions.

  You could choose to use the data set provided, use any open-source data set available you might have access to, or create your own.

  - Download sample Dataset
  - Demonstrate the use of data analytics in identifying:
  - Customer segments, Most popular car specification combination (engine type, fuel, mileage, etc), Right time to launch a new car, etc
  - Any other queries you can think of

Algorithms
  Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.

  Focus on any algorithm that you choose to highlight, for example:

  - Demonstrate what kind of role would a sorting algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine?
  - What is the most efficient sorting algorithm to use in this scenario, and why?
  - Demonstrate what kind of role would a search algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine? Which search algorithm does your app use, and why?
  - Any other algorithm that you can think of.
